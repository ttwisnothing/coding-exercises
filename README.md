# Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges related to number manipulation, card scoring, and clock angles. The challenges are implemented in JavaScript and are aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Files

 - digisible.js: This file implements the `isDigisible` function, which checks if a given positive integer satisfies the conditions of being "digisible" (i.e., each    digit is different, none of the digits is zero, and it is divisible by each of its digits).

 - handscore.js: Here, the `getHandScore` function is implemented to calculate the score of a hand in a card game. The score is determined based on the sum of the        cards in a single suit or the rank of the cards.

 - clockangle.js: The `getClockAngle` function calculates the shorter angle between the hour and minute hands on an analog clock for a given time in "hh:mm" format.
